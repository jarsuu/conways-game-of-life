# Conway's Game of Life
A small demo of Conway's Game of Life.

## Deployment
Check it out **[here on Github Pages](https://jarsuu.github.io/conways-game-of-life/)**.

## Rules
For a space that is populated:
- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

## How to Play
Click on the cells to toggle them alive or dead. Click that "play" button and it plays itself! Click the "pause" button to pause. The left and right arrows show the previous/next frame. The "reset" button will reset to the initial pattern before starting.
